# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, a collection of configurations i reuse between computers.

# Install

I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage the symlinks. All you have to do to install the dotfiles is copy and paste this command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lorenzorapetti/dotfiles/main/install.sh)"
```
